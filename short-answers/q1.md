# Question

What is the primary difference between an HTTP GET request and an HTTP Post request?

# Answer
- The primary difference is that the Http get request method is used to retrieve data from a server at the specified resource. On the other hand Http Post is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
All in all GET request data while POST sends data.
