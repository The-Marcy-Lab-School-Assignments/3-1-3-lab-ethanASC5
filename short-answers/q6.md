# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer
element.append() can append multiple nodes or text strings, and is useful for simpler and more readable code.

An advantage of element.append() is that 
element.appendChild() is more strict and it only accepts a single node. Also it returns the appended node.
